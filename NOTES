TODO's TASK 6
 - Optimize One Way Pathing
  - Update Building Generation (NE, N, NW ...) (ON HOLD)
     - Nice to have Building Type (Stable, Charger, Both)
  - Add Handle for adjacent navigation (Deliver to a building square) (LOL)
     - When you reach the adjacent square move into the building (nice to have)
  - Add user input for consecutive deliveries (AddNewDelivery())
     - User should type in new coordinates and AEDV should then begin to move
