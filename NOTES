TODO's TASK 6
 - Optimize One Way Pathing
  - Update Building Generation (NE, N, NW ...) (ON HOLD)
     - Nice to have Building Type (Stable, Charger, Both)
  - Add Handle for adjacent navigation (Deliver to a building square) (LOL)
     - When you reach the adjacent square move into the building (nice to have)
  - Add user input for consecutive deliveries (AddNewDelivery())
     - User should type in new coordinates and AEDV should then begin to move

Cameron's changes to update-aedv-list-to-linked-list:
- Added var validCharacter in SetupInitialConditions() to simplify the Do While in checking Y or N
- SetupInitialConditions works for the 'N' case (calls AEDV input), with IFDEF LLTest2
- Added FindInList which takes in a list to search by EVIN, and the EVIN to search for. Returns pointer to node if found, NULL ptr otherwise. (LLTest3)
- Added SwapBetweenLists (LLTest4) to move nodes between the lists.

- Added available directions to move for each tile
